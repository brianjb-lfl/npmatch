auth-router
56-57
converted snake to CC before returning user

user-router
174-178
added array type validation for arrays; splice was crashing the app if the arrays were undefined

router-helpers
116
added array type validation for filtered causes; an unlisted cause caused the app to crashing

opp-router
70
changed data check for array to Array.isArray()
88-101
returning all needed fields

starter.sql

120
spelled out id_opportunity
126-130
added organization, firstName, lastName, title; copies of data to be saved at entry to minimize SQL joins (down the road, if the user edits their name or name of the event, we can find these and update them, but I think that will be many fewer fetches and joins than each time they are called up)
